## Technology
    Our DnD Character Manager app is built with a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. JavaScript is used to add dynamic functionality to the app, allowing users to create, store, and manage their characters with ease. HTML is used to structure the app and create the layout, while CSS is used to style the app and make it visually appealing.

## Instalallation
    Our DnD Character Manager app is currently designed to be used directly from the internet, without the need for installation or downloading. However, when the application is completed i will start work on making it into an APK file using PhoneGo or Apache Cordova.
